                <h5>Best Woman</h5>
                <p>Cady and Andy met because Andy was wearing an AFI shirt. Cady, being the outgoing one, decided to talk to the quiet boy in the AFI shirt. They proceeded to sit together for first year Pre-Design class, and all through Graphic Design. Some say they remain best friends to this very day.</p>

                <h4>Brittany Filion</h4>
                <h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
                <p>Almost 10 years ago, Brittany and her sister had just joined a theater group for the first time and knew no-one but themselves. From day one, it was fast-moving and they were trying to just keep up with the flow of the crowd. Michelle was the first person in the group to welcome them with a bright smile and introduce herself personally to the both of them - which was more appreciated than she knows. From the very beginning of her and Brittany's friendship, Michelle has always been warm-hearted and emulates a pleasant peacefulness, leaving people around her feeling welcome and comfortable.</p>
