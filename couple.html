                    <h4>Player 1</h4>
                    <p>Andrew grew up in a small town way up in Northwestern Ontario. He would spend his summers working various jobs and his winters at the curling rink. At the age of 19, he moved to Ottawa to attend the Algonquin College Pre-Design program.  </p>
                    <p>He met Michelle through his college friend and roommate when she had her over one night. They quickly bonded over their love of video games and comic conventions, and together they began sharing those hobbies.</p>

                    <h4>Player 2</h4>
                    <p>Michelle was born and raised in a small town outside of Ottawa. An only child, she learned to be independant at an early age. She's a great lover of animals and the arts, and is not afraid to speak her mind, as anyone who's met her is well aware.</p>
                    <p>When Michelle was 19, she joined a theatre group in Ottawa where she met her friend Cady. Cady had Michelle over one night with some other friends, and Michelle met Andrew, who was Cady's roommate at the time. The rest was history...</p>

            <p>Michelle and Andrew enjoy escape rooms, playing video games, making wine, and trying out new board games. They'd love to travel, but with Michelle in school and the couple saving up for a house, it's just not in the budget, so they make their own adventures at home. They have two cats who are spoiled rotten, and a fish who will survive the apocalypse.</p>
